# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

go-claude-monitor is a command-line tool for monitoring and analyzing Claude Code usage. It processes JSONL log files
from Claude projects, provides real-time monitoring (like Linux `top`), and generates detailed usage reports with cost
analysis.

## Development Commands

### Building and Installation

```bash
make build          # Build binary to bin/go-claude-monitor
make install        # Build and install to GOBIN
make clean          # Remove build artifacts
```

### Testing

```bash
make test           # Run all tests
make coverage       # Generate test coverage report (HTML output in bin/coverage.html)
go test ./internal/session -v    # Run specific package tests
```

### Code Quality

```bash
make fmt            # Format code with go fmt
make lint           # Run go vet for static analysis
make check          # Run fmt, lint, and test combined
```

### Running the Tool

```bash
# Analyze usage (main command)
./bin/go-claude-monitor --duration 7d --breakdown

# Real-time monitoring (like Linux top)
./bin/go-claude-monitor top --plan max5

# Debug session detection (hidden command)
./bin/go-claude-monitor detect
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Commands** (`/commands`): CLI command implementations using Cobra
    - `root.go`: Main analysis command with time filtering, grouping, and output formatting
    - `top.go`: Real-time monitoring interface
    - `detect.go`: Hidden debug command for session detection analysis

2. **Session Management** (`/internal/session`): Core logic for Claude session tracking
    - Window detection: Identifies 5-hour session boundaries using limit messages, time gaps, or hour alignment
    - Real-time tracking: Monitors active sessions, calculates burn rates, and projects costs
    - Caching: Memory-based cache for efficient data processing

3. **Data Processing Pipeline**:
    - **Scanner** (`/internal/scanner`): Finds and reads JSONL files
    - **Parser** (`/internal/parser`): Parses JSONL entries into structured data
    - **Aggregator** (`/internal/aggregator`): Aggregates data by hour and model
    - **Analyzer** (`/internal/analyzer`): Main orchestrator with caching support
    - **Formatter** (`/internal/formatter`): Output formatting (table, JSON, CSV, summary)

4. **Pricing** (`/internal/pricing`): Modular pricing system
    - Supports multiple providers (default, litellm)
    - Cached pricing data for offline mode
    - Plan-based limits (pro, max5, max20, custom)

5. **Utilities** (`/internal/util`):
    - `time.go`: Global timezone-aware time handling
    - `model.go`: Model name simplification and sorting
    - `format.go`: Number, currency, and duration formatting

### Key Design Patterns

- **Concurrent Processing**: Uses worker pools for parallel file processing
- **Caching Strategy**: File-based cache with SHA256 hashing and modification time validation
- **Time Handling**: All time operations go through `TimeProvider` for consistent timezone support
- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing on partial failures, logs errors for debugging

### Session Window Detection

The tool uses sophisticated logic to detect 5-hour session windows:

1. **Limit Messages** (üéØ): Most accurate - extracts reset time from Claude's limit messages
2. **Time Gaps** (‚è≥): Detects >5 hour gaps between messages
3. **First Message** (üìç): Uses first message timestamp for initial sessions
4. **Hour Alignment** (‚ö™): Fallback - rounds to nearest hour

## Data Directory Structure

The tool expects JSONL files in:

- Default: `~/.claude/projects/*/`
- Custom: Specified via `--dir` flag
- Test data: `/data` folder contains sample JSONL files for verification

## Important Notes

- Use `data` folder to verify source JSONL files during development
- All time operations must use `internal/util/time.go` for consistency
- The `detect` command is hidden but useful for debugging session detection
- Real-time monitoring (`top` command) supports plan-based limits and projections
- Caching significantly improves performance for large datasets
